"# A simple 3D car game which uses the Google Maps API to allow you to travel the real world by driving" 

I started by creating an API key on the Google Cloud platform and after I found this (https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/webgl#1)
tutorial related to 3D map experiences using WebGL and ThreeJS.

A map ID had to be implemented to give a custom style to the scene and afterward I replaced the 3D model of the pin with a Ferrari 3D model.

The movements are controlled by changing the coordinates of the car using plain Javascript and the controls are still very basic but there is room for improvement and adding more features as there isn't a limit to the number of 3D models you can add or the animations that you can implement.
